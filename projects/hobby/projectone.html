    <h1>Welcome to my Hobby Webpage</h1>

    Hope you learn something new during your stay.

    <h2>What is my hobby?</h2>

    <p>My name is Nicolas and the hobby I will be discussing about is the creation of writing systems. My interest in this unique hobby comes from my educational background. I have a Bachelors degree in Anthropology and my concentrations were in archaeology and linguistics, so looking at ancient writing systems were always fascinating to me. What I enjoy about this the most is the aesthetics and the complexity of writing systems. While I have always had an interest in writing systems, I've only recently attempted to create one myself.</p>

    <h2>How to get into this hobby?</h2>

    <p>If someone was going to get into this type of hobby, firstly they would have to know the different types of writing systems. For example, a native english speaker would be comfortable with alphabets. A native Japanese speaker would most likely go with a syllabary type of writing system. The easy part about this is that the creator can make their own set of rules for the writing system, so anyone can do it. As for myself, the writing system I am currently developing is based on an alphabetic system of phonetic notation, which means each symbol represents a phonetic sound.</p>

    <h2>What helpful resources are there?</h2>

    <p>There are plenty of helpful resources out there but it will vary depending on the objective of the creator. There is a documentary called <a href="https://conlangingfilm.com">Conlanging, The Art of Crafting Tongues</a> that shows multiple invented languages, even from popular TV series like Game of Thrones. Another resource I use is a website called <a href="https://www.omniglot.com/">Omniglot</a> which covers all types of languages such as historical or constructed. Once I complete my writing system, I plan to submit it to that site for display. Lastly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_writing_systems">Wikipedia's list of writing systems</a> is also useful to explore the different types of writings and gain ideas.</p>
