                   <p>I am an inspiring web developer and UX designer based out of the Bay Area. I am currently studying web developement and graphic design at MEDA. The skills I have gained are HTML, CSS, and graphic design. I also have experience with the adobe applications such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>

                   <p>I am also a recent graduate from the University of California - Santa Cruz. I studied anthropology with concentrations in the sociocultural and linguistic sub-fields. My academic experience in anthropology has provided me with the skill set to conduct research on various aspects of human society through qualitative/quantitative methods in ethnographic accounts. Using my education can complement UX/UI.</p></p>
